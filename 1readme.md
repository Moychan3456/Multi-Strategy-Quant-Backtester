# 📊 Multi-Strategy Quant Backtester

This project implements a **multi-strategy backtesting framework** for FX trading on the **4H timeframe**.
It combines three independent price-action strategies with dynamic risk management and evaluates them through professional performance metrics, risk analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations.

🚀 **Goal:** Demonstrate quantitative research, portfolio thinking, and risk-adjusted evaluation of trading strategies.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* **Diversification Benefit:** Low correlation across strategies reduces risk.
* **Robustness:** Monte Carlo confirms actual equity curve lies within the 5–95% percentile band.
* **Stability:** Max drawdown of only -2.54% makes it capital efficient.
* **Best Performer:** Strategy 3 had the strongest standalone performance (Sharpe 1.04, Sortino 4.99).
* **Return Distribution:** Histogram highlights trade-level asymmetry and presence of fat tails.

## ⚡ Next Steps

* Extend framework to multi-currency FX portfolio.
* Add volatility-scaling / Kelly position sizing.
* Expand strategy library to include trend-following and mean-reversion models.
